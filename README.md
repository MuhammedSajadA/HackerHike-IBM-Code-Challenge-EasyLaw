# Easy Hack

This project is make as a part of IBM Coding Challenge 2021. The Application that makes laws accessible to common man.

## Problem Statement

There are more than a 1000 laws in our country. A number of them affect us directly or indirectly. It doesn’t take a few moves to realize that we might be on the wrong side of the law. A common man has little knowledge about these, most times, complicated laws. This in turn leads to a lack of awareness among the general public. It can be as simple as the documents that are needed to be carried while driving, or a land dispute and legal actions. 
The lack of awareness of laws prove costly to most of us, as challans, fines, and even the fee for a lawyer. 
The availability of these laws in a simplified manner would ease a lot of doubts people of India have.
